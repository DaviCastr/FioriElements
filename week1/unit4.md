## Introduction
In this unit you will set up your development environment that you need for the next units. 

In the first step you will create a trial account on SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP). Please mind, that the trial environment is for educational purposes only, not for productive usage. Also, the lifetime is limited.

After that, the ABAP environment on SAP BTP needs to be set up. We use SAP BTP as itâ€™s very easy to get an ABAP environment. Also, you are always working on the latest version of ABAP platform which gives you access to the latest features and improvements.

Last step in this unit is to install ABAP Development Tools which then gets connected to the ABAP environment on SAP BTP.

**For the exercises of weeks 1-3 this is a prerequisite.**

## Step 1. Get a free trial account on SAP Business Technology Platform
You need a free trial account for the SAP Business Technology Platform to do the exercises.

**Your account needs to be assigned to either Europe or US East. Singapore is currently not supporting the ABAP environment on SAP BTP.**
